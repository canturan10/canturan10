# 👋 Hello there
I'm Oğuzcan Turan. I'm a new graduated computer engineer.

I had the opportunity to study and do an internship for 4 months in Brighton, England. I have successfully completed this opportunity, which is the most important beginning of my career on computer.

In 2015, I won the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association and graduated as an Honor Student in 2020.

At the same time, as a freelancer, I work on different topics and I enjoy supporting entrepreneurial people like me.
